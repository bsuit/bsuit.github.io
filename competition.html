                    <br>
                    <p> The bSUIT Coding Contest, held by bSUIT every quarter, is a global coding competition where programmers can gain coding experience regardless of their background. Contestants will be constantly challenged with algorithmic problems around the clock. For highly ranked participants, bSUIT will provide networking opportunities to employers of 500+ tech companies.
                        <br> <br> 
                        Each problem brings new types of challenges to the contestant and everyone will have the chance to put their algorithmic skills to the test!
